Connect4

About: This is a game for the TI-nSpire! It works on the TI-NSpire CX with ndless 3.6 and should work on all of the TI-nspire models.  I did not write it; but ported over Keith Pomakis's console program: http://www.pomakis.com/c4/

The goal is get 4 (or more) of your pieces in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) before the other player.

How to put on calculator: Start up TI-NSpire Student Software or whatever you use to put it on the calculator. Then just drag-n-drop the connect4.prg.tns file into the application to transfer it to your calculator. You have to have ndless 3.6 on your calculator in order to run it!

How to play: First choose the width of the board; you can just press the enter key to use the default or type a desired width.  Next choose the height of the board (or press enter for default).  Choose how many in a row is needed.

If you want to play against the AI player have just 1 human player.  Otherwise you can have the computer play itself or you can have two human players and pass the calculator between turns.  For skill level of the computer first start with the default so you get a feel for how long it takes to think per turn.  Higher number is stronger and lower numbers are weaker players.  I made it so 8 is the highest on the calculator but checkout the source and compile it yourself if you want to play a higher skill level.

After than you choose the column you want to drop your piece into and continue to do so until the end of the game.

If you want to quit type q and hit enter when it asks for a column.  If you want to quit while the AI is thinking hold down either the esc key or the q key until the program quits.

Source: I included the source source.  The original source was programmed by Keith Pomakis: http://www.pomakis.com/c4/ and I added to it some things to make it work better on the calculator.
